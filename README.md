# E-commerce-Website

Developed for the subject Database Management Systems (DBMS) using Java and Spring Boot. We have used the Oracle database. 
The rationale behind choosing this topic for DBMS:

- Famous e-commerce websites like Amazon have always fascinated us with the wide range of products they provide.
- An e-commerce website needs to have lot of functionality like viewing products, adding products to cart and Wishlist, deleting products from cart and Wishlist, and purchasing products.
- The wide range of functions call for a variety of database calls like select, insert, update, and delete.
